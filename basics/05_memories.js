/*

Two type of memories HEAP (NON-PRIMITIVE) and STACK (PRIMITIVE)
STACK (PRIMITIVE) -> whenever we declare variable using strack memory we get copy of variable.

HEAP (NON-PRIMITIVE) - > whenever we declare variable using heap memory we get reference of value
i.e if we make change then it will change the original value.
